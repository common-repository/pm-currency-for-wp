It allows approx 100 requests per minute for free (which is mostly good for most of the Wordpress sites) so if your site gets more than 100 visits per minute then consider upgrading and whitelisting your server IP address by visiting https://www.geoplugin.com/ By using this plugin, you also agree to GEOPLUGIN privacy policy and terms of use which is available at https://www.geoplugin.com/privacy

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= How Does It Work? =
 
Once you install and activate the plugin, you have to use short tags [wpcurrency]AMOUNT[wpcurrency] anywhere you wish and whatever value you write in place of AMOUNT will automatically be converted into site visitor local currency from USD.
 
= So Does It Convert From USD Only? =
 
Yes the free version plugin base currency is USD only so it will convert from USD to whatever site visitor local currency is. However if you need to set any other base currency, please upgrade to pro and the pro plugin will allow you to set base currency from out of 75+ currency choices.
